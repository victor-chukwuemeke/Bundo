This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started
-Before running the server, after cloning the project.
-switch branch to working.
use
 ```bash
npm install --legacy-peer-deps 
(This is because there is an old package used and there hasn't been any form of update for it)
```
Then, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open (http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
